            <strong>The N95 mask</strong> is a form of respiratory protective
            wear worn over the nose and mouth to help minimise the chance of
            inhaling airborne particles like viruses and other germs. It is a
            disposable mask made from synthetic polymer fibres produced in a
            highly specialised process called melt blowing. During this process,
            the inner layer of the N95 mask is created which forms the
            filtration layer capable of filtering out at
            <strong>least 95%</strong> of airborne particles when worn
            correctly.
          </p>
          <p class="section-about__text">
            During outbreaks of respiratory illnesses and during periods of
            intense air pollution, wearing <b>N95 masks</b> has been shown to
            help reduce the inhalation of compromised air, filtering out nasty
            pathogens which lead to illness or which can aggravate existing
            respiratory problems. Maintaining clear and unhindered respiration
            is vitally important for remaining fit and healthy and people with
            pre-existing conditions or respiratory fragility can particularly
            benefit from wearing face masks while they are out in public and
            unable to control the breathing environments that they find
            themselves in.

            N95 Respirators In Industrial And Health Care Settings
          </div>
          <p class="section-about__text">
            Most <strong>N95 respirators</strong> are manufactured for use in
            construction and other industrial type jobs that expose workers to
            dust and small particles. They are regulated by the National
            Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL) in the National
            Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), which is part
            of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
          </p>
          <p class="section-about__text">
            However, some N95 respirators are intended for use in a health care
            setting. Specifically, single-use, disposable respiratory protective
            devices used and worn by health care personnel during procedures to
            protect both the patient and health care personnel from the transfer
            of microorganisms, body fluids, and particulate material. These
            surgical N95 respirators are class II devices regulated by the FDA,
            under 21 CFR 878.4040, and CDC NIOSH under 42 CFR Part 84.
